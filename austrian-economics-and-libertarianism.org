The message of taxation is clear: reduce the waiting time; shorten the

The signal of taxation is sent to persons whose actions are invariably

the alternative between work and no work at all but also one between
producing a valuable asset in more or less time-consuming ways.

Until about the mid-nineteenth century a constant series of upheavals
gradually stripped away governmental exploitation to an all-time low
all over Western Europe.

The idea that had conquered public opinion and that had made this
reduction of governmental power possible was that individual freedom
and private property are just, self-evident, natural, inviolable and
ho[ly], and that any invader of such rights should be regarded and
treated as a contemptuous outcast.

*** Summary
**** I

Barter and money arise naturally from the free action of self
interested individuals. With money, the individual avoids the
necessity of the rare event of finding someone who has what one wants,
and who wants what one has.

Gold is naturally chosen by men as the best commodity money. Also, it
is natural that an universal commodity money appears. Local moneys
would all be driven out of market by gold.

Money is good. It expands the market for one's production, which in
turns increases consumption and production. Money also leads to the
birth of banks, which will take care of people's money.

We should have many banks, but only one money. Competition on the
banking system would create incentive for efficiency usage of
resources on banking.

If we do have competing money, this is because of coercion from
governments.

Bankers are easily tempted to create more bank notes then there are
actually assets in deposit. This creates an economic cycle of
boom-bust, since these expanded credit does not correspond to
increased savings.

*** Summary
**** Intro

- Led by greed, banks started violating the Irregular-Deposit Contract
  (deposit of fungible goods)
- From this practice they extracted enormous profits
- Legal authorities were slowly made aware of the process
- Instead of defending private property, legal authorities created
  privileges for bankers. Eventually, they even created their own
  banks (XVII century onward)
- This process has happened in greece an rome, as well as in trading
  cities during late middle ages, and happens on the modern state.

**** Banking in Classic Greece

- Huerta lists a handful descriptions of bank frauds in Greece
- These descriptions come from legal accusations surrounding bank
  deposits which could not be honored
- Bankers would make use of depositors money. When the depositor
  wanted to withdraw, the resource was not available. Bankers would
  then try very hard to hide the occurrence, and even deny the
  deposit.
- Huerta points that even in Greece there were already cases of crysis
  triggered by bank activity.
- He also lists the first case were government created special
  privileges to bankers, allowing them to not pay deposits back for a
  period of 10 years.
- Because bankers are rich, people consider them highly. The banking
  business lives of this trust people have in bankers.
- The first Greek banks were religious temples, which were specially
  safe exactly because they were religious places.

**** Banking in the Helenistic Period (when Roma was the shit)

- The first state bank happened in Egypt. It did not have monopoly,
  though they already introduced the practice of private bankers
  keeping their assets in the state bank.
- Romans had banks as well, though there are fewer vestiges of
  descriptions of frauds. Roman law does emphasize a lot the nature of
  irregular deposit contracts, from which we can infer that these
  happened.
- The romans did not have a state bank though. There was a proposal,
  but it was never approved.
- Bankers in Rome started the practice of creating a guild to protect
  their interests. The permission for banking was already granted by
  the state. Also, private civilians could join their funds to start a
  bank, and the concept of unlimited liability was created (the
  owners' assets were game for paying deposits).

**** The late middle ages

- The Templários had their version of bank. They were honest and
  prospered. A king in French terminated them in order to keep their
  riches.
- Banking also happened in the Italian cities. Again, the bussines
  start right, but eventually becomes fraudulent. Government, instead
  of protecting the law, creates privileges from bankers, and then try
  to benefit somehow from the practice (either taxing banks of
  creating their own banks).

(greek writing of a guy suing a bank)

When the client, greatly surprised by the banker’s behavior, again
claimed payment from Passio, he said the banker, after covering his
head, cried and said he had been forced by economic difficulties to
deny my deposit but would soon try to return the money to me; he asked
me to take pity on him and to keep his poor situation a sec[ret] so it
would not be dis- covered he had committed fraud.

from infla[tionary] government policies which devalued the currency,
and from the establishment of maximum prices for essential goods,
which in turn caused a general [shortage||"shortage" or "surplus"] of these goods, the financial

In order to assess whether the factory is a net benefit or a horrible
waste we must put prices (or some substitute measure of cost) on the
factory’s outputs and inputs. We then have to be able to determine
whether the factory is making a ‘pro[fit]’ or a ‘loss’—whether all the
resources used in producing the output are greater or less than the
value of that output.

**** COMMODITY PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTION FOR USE

- Marx defines "commodity" as "goods produced for sales" as opposed of
  "for usage"
- If we think about it, no production is "for sales". Capitalist only
  produce because someone wants to use it.
- On the flip side, industrial production in a communist society is
  also not for direct use. It also for the usage of an unspecified
  someone else. In this sense, communist production is just like
  capitalist production
- Finally, communist are confused about the necessity of abolishing
  money. Marx states it is the final goal. Soviets proposed this then
  backed away, and said that they would better focus on the "immediate
  struggle", and that shooting for Marx abolishion of money was
  counter-revolutionary. Still, some reference books still mention
  abolishion of money as the ultimate goal.
