Kesting's 101 offensive strategy consists in the following
transitions:

- In your opponent's guard switch to sid[emount]
- From there to Kne[emount] (or directly to mount)
- Then to mo[unt] (or directly to rearmount)
- Finally to re[armount]

His 101 deffensive strategy consists in: from any bad position either
a) transition to gu[ard], or b) transition to tu[rtle], then to guard

When a leg or foot is used to control an opponent it is referred to as
a ho[ok].

to passing his Guard is usually a [mistake|| "win" or "mistake"].
