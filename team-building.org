Traditionally, reliability is measured as t[ime] b[etween]
f[ailures]. However, in modem software products and services, which
are rapidly changing complex systems, failure is inevitable, so the
key question becomes: How quickly can service be r[estored]?

There are five *key principles* at the heart of continuous delivery:

- build qu[ality] in
- work in sm[all] batches
- Computers perform rep[etitive] tasks; people solve pr[oblems]
- Relentlessly pursue con[tinuous] improvement
- Everyone is res[ponsible].

9 key capabilities that drive Continuous Delivery:

- The use of ve[rsion] control for application code, system
  configuration, application configuration, and build and
  configuration scripts
- Comprehensive te[st] automation that is reliable, easy to fix, and
  runs regularly
- Deployment au[tomation]
- Continuous in[tegration]
- Shifting le[ft] on security: bringing security—and security teams—in
  process with software delivery rather than as a downstream phase
- Using tr[unk]-based development as opposed to long-lived feature
  branches
- Effective test da[ta] management
- A loosely coupled, well-encapsulated arc[hitecture]
- Teams that can choose their own to[ols]
