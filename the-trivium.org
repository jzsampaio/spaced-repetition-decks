* The Trivium

- In nature there are no contradictions.
- Contradictions exist on things created by man.
- Process:
    * Represent nature (gather data)
    * Remove contradictions from your representation (get to a complete understanding)
    * Communicate to others (wisdom)
- Paradox:
    * apparent contradiction on nature
- Contradiction:
    * contradiction on man made concept
- An educated man could consider any topic thoroughly without
  embracing it (emotionally) (nor dismiss it).
- Liberal arts: they free the mind.

** Logic

- Definitions
- Common Logic Fallacies (from 20 ~ 30)
    * a shortcut to dismiss ideas
    * 1. Argument by authority
    * 2. Argument against the man
    * 3. Argument from force
    * 4. Argument of ignorance
    * 5. Only a positive affirmation can be proven

** Grammar
** Rhetoric
* The System of Thomas Acquinus

** TODO I - Introduction (NEED REVIEW)

- what is knowing?
    * an object is known when it is present in a certain way in the
      knowing consciousness
- The privilege of a being which knows consists precisely in this
  ability of being enriched by something which belongs to
  something else
- non-knowing beings have only their own reality, but knowing beings
  are capable of possessing also the reality of something else.
- knowing of the ideal order
    * knowable as a result of the mere juxtaposition of the terms
- knowing of the existential order: requires experience
- Epistemology is the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to
  its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation
  of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.

** TODO II - Different Kinds of Knowledge

- 2 kinds of knowledge
    * knowledge of particular objects
    * intellectual knowledge (abstract and general)
- Forms of intellectual knowledge
    * Idea
    * Judgement: realizing that the content of 2 ideas (2 objects
      present to the mind) are in mutual agreement or disagreement
    * Reasoning: producing a new judgement by means of two others
- The mind must make judgements because [we are incapable of grasping
  by one single insight all that there is in a real being]. We hunt
  and stalk reality but never completely capture it.

** TODO III - How Our Knowledge Is Formed

** TODO IV - The Directing Principles of Knowledge

- directing principles of knowledge:
    * principle of contradiction (a thing cannot both be and not be)
    * identity (being is equal to itself)
    * excluded middle (there is no middle term betwee being and non-being)
    * sufficient reason (being is endowed with all the elements
      without which it could not be)
    * totality (the whole is equal to the sum of its parts)
    * efficient causality (non-necessary beings exists by the
      influence of a being other than itself)
** V - Various Aspects of the Epistemological Problem

- The problem of truth is considered by Aquinas from 2 points:
    * methaphysical: Good is infinite. Everything derives from Him. He
      creates the world, as well as the mind to understand the world.
    * Psycological:
        + To start the conversation, we review the data (the facts)
          about the certitude of truth:
            - a) we get to it by reflection of believes formed
              spontaneously in our minds
            - b) truth is an attribute of judgements (propositions)
            - c) the examination of expontaneous judgements is carried
              based on top of judgements form previously through
              reflection

** TODO VI - Moderate Realism and the Universals
** VII - Desire and Freedom

- Nothing is desired unless it is first known
- Appetite is the tendency of a knowing subject towards what it
  perceives as good;
- Just as knowledge is twofold, so is appetite:
    * sense appetite: succeeds an act of sense perception
    * will: succeeds an act of abstract representation
- Emotions (such as love, hatred, courage, fear, and anger) accompany
  and intensify sense appetite.
- In the field of our earthly activity we are confronted only by
  partially good things:
    * Each good thing is good only from certain points of view, and is
      deficient from others. Consequently, the intellect presents us
      with two judgements. Which shall I accept? It is the will which
      must make the choice, and the decision will be quite free, since
      neither judgment demands necessarily our assent. We choose
      freely the good as offered by one of both judgements, not
      because it is a greater good, but because it possesses some
      good.
    * In point of fact, the will can give its preference to either of
      the alternatives, by loading the scale as it were.
- Liberty manifests itself in two forms:
    * exercise of will (or liberty of exercise): you can choose to
      choose later
    * and choice
- Liberty belong to the domain of consciousness
    * external violence does not affect it
    * carrying out of actions is a result of a free decision
- Clear mental vision is the primordial condition of the normal
  exercise of liberty;
- Liberty presupposes a mind which reflects upon and judges its own
  judgment
- We are liable to be influenced by our emotions, passions,
  sentiments, and may be overcome by their disordered promptings,
  unless we take the precaution to discipline them by our reason
    * Our again, our spontaneous sympathy or preference for one of the
      alternatives may obscure the real value of the objects of choice
- Anything which clarifies the mental vision of things increases
  thereby our liberty, and conversely, whatever darkens the
  intelligence diminishes our freedom

** TODO VIII - A Universe of Individuals
** IX - The Process of Change

- actuality is any present degree of reality
- potency is the aptitude or capacity of reaching that stage of
  reality

** TODO X - Soul and Body
** TODO XI - God
** XII - Personal Conduct and Moral Values

- The activity of man is characterized by te[leology], i.e., he desires
  certain things as ends, and he wills other things as means to these
  ends.
- The study of human conduct as directed by us towards an end forms
  the subject matter of [Ethics].
- Moral Philosophy is also known as [Ethics].
- The g[ood] is that which all desire.
- Nothing is more personal than conduct, and the ends we aim at in our
  lives. The end is a personal one, because man is an in[dividual]
  su[bstance].
- An end which is subordinated to another, or is useful, becomes a
  m[eans].
- We do make actual decisions, and in order to explain their
  actuality, there must be some real end towards which they are
  directed. Otherwise we should be led into an in[finite]
  reg[ression], which is an absurd.
- The truly human good ought to consist in that which will satisfy our
  specifically human aspirations: intelligence and will.
- human asp[irations]: those faculties which are the highest we
  possess: intelligence and will.
- the happiness which corresponds to our mode of being will consist in
  kno[wing] and l[oving].
- Is it possible to man to achieve his ultimate good? Scholastic Moral
  Philosophy says that [yes].
- When confronted with a good thing which our minds regard as simply
  good and without defect, we necessarily w[ill] it.
- Liberty enters only in the choice of things which are pa[rtially]
  good.
- It is f[ree] act which is endowed with morality.
- A morally good or bad act is always a f[ree] act.
- A thing or act is morally good only if it is in agreement with the
  t[rue] e[nd] of m[an], and contribute directly or indirectly to our
  real perfection.
- From the moral point of view, pleasure and wealth are neither good
  nor evil. They only become so when the will, guided by the reason,
  either does or does not employ them in the service of the tr[uly]
  hu[man] g[ood], by allocating them their proper place in the scale
  of values.
- Factors that contribute to the richness of morality of an act:
    * in[trinsic] ch[aracter]
    * in[tention]
    * cir[cumstances]

** XIII - Obligation and Moral Law

- Among acts which are morally good some are ob[ligatory]
- Moral obligation consists in the necessity of willing our su[preme]
  go[od], combined with the lib[erty] of ch[oosing] the concrete
  objects wherein it is in fact realized.
- Moral obligation is founded upon hu[man] na[ture] itself and its
  need of w[ell]-b[eing].
- A moral law governs (only the majority / the totality) of cases?
  Only the majority.
- Aquinas distinguishes 2 kinds of commands dictated by the natural
  law to man. These 2 principles explain the fi[xity] and va[riability] of
  laws. The 2 principles are the following.
    * the fundamental command to act ac[cording] to re[ason]
    * principles which we may describe as ci[rcumstantial]
- If an act freely willed, moral or immoral, had nothing to do with
  merit or demerit then liberty would no longer have a su[fficient]
  ree[ason].

** XIV - Conscience and Moral Virtue

- Moral virtue is the result of moral conduct in the p[ast], and the
  source of similar conduct in the f[uture].
- The moral virtues are:
    * pr[udence] :: right reasoning concerning things to be done
    * ju[stice] :: to will firmly and permanently to render to each
      one his due
    * fo[rtitute] :: regulates boldness and fear
    * te[mprerance] :: limits our appetites
- A pr[udent] man is one who by the frequency of practical judgments
  which consider all the circumstances sees and decides rapidly and
  without hesitation what is to be done in a particular case.
- Ri[ght], or that which is just, is some work related to another
  according to some kind of equity.
- Right presupposes the living together of many human beings in a
  co[mmunity].

** XV - Group Life and the State

- The group life is necessary precisely and only because of this
  insufficiency of the individual for his own needs
- The collectivity exists for the sake of the individual, and not the
  individual for the collectivity.
- A few of the prerogatives of the indivual from the ~Declaration of
  the Rights of Man~:
    * to preserve his life
    * to marry
    * to bring up children
    * to develop his intelligence
    * to be instructed
    * to hold to the truth
    * to live in Society
- sovereignty :: the power of a man to command and rule his fellows

** TODO XVI - The Construction of the Sciences
** XVII - The Aesthetic Aspect of the Universe

- Any external product of man may possess beauty
- If a man transforms preexisting realities, then he is an artist
- Beauty is real and has an objective aspect
- Beauty is found in those things which realize and manifest:
    * multiplicity of parts
    * variety
    * unity of plan (which combines the parts into one coherent whole)
- Order becomes sethetic only when it speaks clearly and with no
  uncertain voice to a human intelligence by means of sensations, and
  thus brings to the mind the pleasure of disisterested contemplation;

** XVIII - Classification of the Sciences and Divisions of Philosophy

- Philosophy is defines as the investigation of all things by means of
  that which is fundamental in them and common to all;
- Philosophy subvides into:
    * practical :: studies the universal order in so far as it enters
      into relation with our conscious life
    * theoretical (os speculative) :: seeks knowledge for its own sake
- Theoretical philosophy sub-divides futher into:
    * Physics :: studies change
    * Mathematics :: studies quantity
    * Metaphysics :: studies being and the general determinations of
      being (such as essence, existence, substance, unity, goodness,
      action, totality, causality, ...)
- Since man is part of the sense reality, psycology is part of
  physics, as well as the epistemological inquiry;
- Practical philosophy subdivides futher into:
    * Moral Philosophy (Ethics), individual and social
    * Logic
    * Esthetics

** XIX - Doctrinal Characteristics of Scholasticism

- Truth, for Thomas, cannot contradict truth; and a doctrine, once
  established in one department, has validity in all others.
- 3 doctrines on top of which the coherence of Thomism relies:
    * intellectualism (the supremacy of reason)
        + We apprehend reality by means of abstractions; and though
          such a mode of knowing is poor and restricted, nevertheless
          it is man's privilege, and raises him above the mere animal
          kingdom
    * emphasis of the value of human personality
        + it declares each man to be an autonomous being, possessing
          his own body and his own soul, an agent with his own
          intelligence, will, and powers of action
    * central place of God
- Reason leads to faith, philosophy to theology
- The life of the Christian appears as a more complete approach to God

* Five Proofs of the Existence of God
** Ch I - The Aristotelian Proof

- Change occurrs
- Change involves the actualization of potential
- Change requires a changer
    * A hot coffee contains the potential of being cold, but potential
      cold cannot turn into actuality alone, otherwise, the coffee
      would be all that it can at once, and we don't see this
      happening;
- Some potentials are actualized, and when they are, there must be
  something already actual which actualizes them
- Sometimes when potential is actualized by a changer, what actualizs
  is itself being changed, and there must be something further causing
  this change
- A hierarchical series of causes must have a first member (not
  necessarily a first temporal member)
- There are 2 kinds of series in which a member is caused by its
  predecessor: linear and hierarchical series
    * in one hierarchical series of causality, the intermerdiary links
      can only move the next link due to it's predecessor. They have
      derivativa causal powers.
    * The very first link is able to move the following ones without
      requiring a previous link. This first link changes without being
      changed. It moves without being moved. It acts without having
      been acted.
- Where can we find such hierarchical sequence?
    * It doesn't take us to go back in time.
    * We can find one at each frozen moment of time. What causes a cup
      of coffe to exist? It's water. What causes it? It's atoms. Keep
      going. There must be something which exist without needing
      something else to explain its existence.
- From the fact that change occurrs, we are lead to conclude that
  there must be an Unmoved Mover.
- Why call the Unmoved Moved "God"?
- Various further attributes definitive of God as traditionally
  conceived follow from the Unmoved Mover
    * The cause of things is pure actuality, and thus has no
      potential. It cannot change.
    * Existing in time entails changeability (e.g.: growing
      older). Thus the thing that cannot change exists outside of
      time.
    * Because the Unmoved Mover cannot change, there is nothing which
      its nature would dictate that it did, that it doesn't. The
      Unmoved Moves is thus perfect according to its nature.
    * Could there be 2 of euch Unmoved Movers? Given one UM is
      perfect, there would be no difference in between them. Plus,
      they are not corporeal, and timeless. It is impossible for us
      to differentiate between the 2.
    * By being perfect, there is nothing that nature says the UM
      should do that it doesn't. The UM is said to be perfectly good.
- Can we find more attribute for the Unmoved Mover? Perhaps, to call
  it intelligent?
    * Let's consider what is intelligence. Intelligence comprises of 3
      capacities:
        + abstract ideas
        + connection between abstract ideas (propositions)
        + reasoning between one proposition and another
    * abstract ideas are the pure forms which all things that exist
      have
    * To have abstract ideas is to have in one's mind a reality of
      other beings
    * Now consider the law of causality: change is explained by the
      actualization of a potential by something which is already
      actual
    * And the law of proportionate causaility that states the effect
      is somehow already present in the cause
    * Consider that in the act of creating specific things, these
      things must match specific forms
    * The actual cause of all things must somehow contain the abstract
      forms of all things (the first capacity of intelligence)
    * Consider also, that the actual cause creates not only the
      things, but also all the relation between things. These
      relations must exist in the actual cause in the form of thoughts
      (connection between absctract concepts)
    * It is now clear that the actual cause possesses 2 of the 3
      fundamental capacities of intelligence.
- Common objections:
    * How are we so sure the universe had a beggining? We are not, and
      time is irrelevant for the argument. The argument focuses on
      what causes actuality of the the universe at a given moment in
      time;
    * Why does everything have a cause? The key assumption of the
      argument is that "everything that changes must have a cause".
    * What caused God? Again: everything that changes must have an
      external cause
- Physical based objections:
    * E.g.: Newton's innertia: the body is change it's position
      without any external actuator. Eisten's 4 dimensional space-time
      in which there is no change and the future exists the same way
      the present and the past. Quantum mechanics w/ 1. particles
      popping out of existence, 2. indeterminism, and 3. something I
      don't know.
    * Newton's law describe an equation that is good for prediction,
      but it tells nothing about causality. Physics laws are like
      this.  They abstract away and mathemacize nature, but can be
      applied only to that which can be turned into mathematics.
    * Causality is in the realm of philosophy and it caputres a deeper
      aspect of the universe than what physics can capture.
    * Think of an artist which draws a picture in black and white. The
      fact the picture has no colors in it does not mean there are not
      colors in nature. Colores were removed by the very method the
      artist used to represent nature. The same happens to physics
      (the method) and causality (color in nature).
    * Similar refutation can be applied to arguments against causality
      brought forth based on Einsten's relativity and Quantum
      Mechanics.
    * Also: a law os physics is a shorthand description for the way a
      thing will behave given it's nature. Changes that happen "due to
      a law of physics" are simply a "formal cause" to Aristotle.
    * Note: not all causality is deterministic. A sample of that is
      the decaying process of unstable atoms.
- Objection: this proof is based on outdate concepts
    * Not all Aristotelian ideas have been proven wrong
    * The concept of potential and actualization is one from
      metaphysics. It is philosophical, not scientific.
    * Are there really hierarchical causal changes? Humes argues that
      causes and effects are nor simultaneous.
        * immediate causes are always simultaneous with their effects.
        * remember that “simultaneous” does not entail “instantaneous”
- The following is an analogy to explain why even in an infinite
  hierarchical series, there must be something outside of it which
  starts the chain of Being:
       #+begin_quote
       Or consider a mirror which reflects the image of a face present in
       another mirror, which in turn reflects the image of a face present in
       another, and so on ad infinitum. Even if we allowed that there could
       be such a series of mirrors, there would still have to be something
       outside this infinite series—the face itself—which could impart the
       content of the image without having to derive it.
       #+end_quote
- Even if there is one initial cause, how are we sure it has no other
  potential? Maybe this initial cause does not change when it is
  suporting everything else, but it could change at a different moment
    * If the first cause A has indeed a potential, who actualizes
      that?  A few options:
        + A further cause B: so A is not really the first actualizer
        + A itself: But then A must be composed of 2 parts - A' purely
          actual and A'' w/ potencial. It is A' the pure potenrial
          which is indeed the first actualizer, and A'' simply one of
          its causes.
        + A itself: But A' is a mix of purely actual and potential. In
          that case, who actualies the potential of A'? A' itself must
          be composed of 2 parts: one actual A'x and one w/ potential
          A'y. And so on and so forth. There must be one purely actual
          A to start the whole chain.
        + From a purely action first cause, all the divine attributes
          must follow.
*** In My Own Words

We know there is change in world. Our senses inform us that things are
changing. If if we didn't have the senses, ss we think, our mind
itself changing. As we learn, we acquire realities which were not
previously in us. Change exists.

How can things change? When an object A turns into B. Where did B came
from? When objects A and B combine into C, where did C came from? It
seems we assume the world is not mad nor magic. Objects don't pop out
of existence. Objects change, but they don't pop out, nor they are
destroyed. The only way A turns into B is if B is already present in
A. How can that? A is A, not B. But B must be in A at time T, if at
any moment T2 > T, A turns in B.

We will say that A potentially contains B, or, that B is in the
potential of A. Now, not necessarily A turns into B. It could be the
case, that A turned into C. The whole set of future possibilities for
A all live in the potential of A. What is the difference between A and
the Pot(A)? Elements of Pot(A) are potentials, whereas A is
actual. And how can an actual A turn into any of it's potential B? Can
A, and object that has potential, turn itself into B?

If so, how would A pick any of it's potentials? Why B and not C (also
in Pot(A))? The world would be madness if objects could change
themselves. Could A turn itself into any Pot(A) through a
probabilistic rule? What a strange universe this would be. I am not
sure this does not happen on quantum mechanics, but it seems clear it
doesn't happen on macroscopic objects. This seems a core assumption as
we move on: object A with non empty Pot(A) cannot change itself. When
it seems it does, it could be because it is actually composed of
sub-objects, which are not changing themselves (and thus follow the
core assumption), but which interact in ways we don't understand, and
thus we can only model the probabilistic behavior.

So A must be changed by another object X. This is theory of
potentials: an object w/ potential can change into any form present
into its potentials, but only by the action of another external actual
object. A (A real) turns into A' (A' in Pot(A)), by action of X (X !=
A, X real). X is said to be the cause of the change of A into A'.

Whenever we observe change we can ask: what was the cause of the
chage? Whe can ask: why? When we do so, we want our mind to become
aware of another object that caused the change we observe.

What about when we don't observe change? An object has potential, but
yet at any given moment, an object is exactly one of its
possibilities. Can we still ask why? Why is it A and not A' at any
given moment? It seems we could answer w/ causality: A doesn't change
unless an external real object changes it. A is A because no one has
changed it. But why does A follow this rule? We could say that A is
such an object whose nature is to follow causality. But why? Does the
question "why" make sense in this case? It seems valid: we want to
know the actual object that caused A to be of such nature.

Is it the case that all questions which make sense can be answered?
What is the expected answer to "Why". Is there any case in which "Why"
is nonsense? "Why do objects follow the rule of causality?" Can this
be asked? What could possible answers to "Why" encompass?

When we ask "Why" we want to find more primitive causes of a an
observed reality. These causes could themselves be caused by something
else. If they are, we could ask why, and keep investigating the more
primitive causes. However, the answer to any "why" might be a
fundamental answer, which cannot be explained in terms of anything
else. And how do we know if we have reached such fundamental answer?

Back to "why do objects follow the rule of causality?". Could the
answer be: "These objects follow the rule of causality, and this
sentence is a fundamental one (that cannot be further broke down)".
How many fundamental properties are out there? "Space exists and this
is a fundamental rule". "Time exists and this is a fundamental rule",
... We could build a set of all the fundamental rule. And then we
could ask: why does this set exist? And this would be yet another
fundamental rule, so the set would have to include itself. Which seems
ok.

Let's try a different question: "what caused or what causes". The
answer to "what causes" or "what is the cause" must be an object (I
think the best word here is Being). What is an object? We say reality
is composed of objects. Each object however can be isolated from
reality and analysed independently. Objects exist separately from one
another. The answer to "what causes" must be an isolated part of
reality. Can we now ask: "what causes objects to follow the rule of
causality?". The answer could be X. And X is either sufficient or not.
If it is not sufficient we will ask what causes X. If it is sufficient
we will say that X causes other object to follow causality, and X is
sufficient (it cannot be caused by anything else).

Summarizing so far: things w/ potential change, and when they do, they
need another external thing to change it. If this other thing that
caused the change has potential, we can keep asking: what caused this
thing.

*** In My Own Words - Attempt 2

Change exists. And change entails the actualization of a potential by
another actor which is actual. Substace A can only turn into A', A'
belonging to the potential of A, by action of an external substance X
which is actual and can cause change.

Change only occur to substances. If change C occurs, it must be
occurring into into a substance S. If S exists and has the potential
for not existing, then there must be a concurrent cause for the
actualization of the existence of S. So at any moment, any substance S
has an actualizer A of S's existence.

If ~A~ exists, it is either: 1. dependent upon another A' for
actualizing its existence, or 2. ~A~ is pure existence. This chain of
actulizer must end at an spacial ~A~ which is pure existence.

The occurence of C, thus the existence of S, pressuposes the existence
of a pure actualizer.

** Ch II - The Neo-Platonic Argument (from Plotinus)

- Whatever is composite has a cause;
- The ultimate cause must be a non composite Being, which will be
  called The One;
- The One can also be proved to hold the divine attributes. It is also
  pure actuality.
- we started from the idea of things that are composed of parts, and
  concluded that there must be something which is simple or
  noncomposite.
- The intellect, omnipotence, eternity, immateriality, and so forth of
  the One are really all one and the same thing, just conceived of or
  described in different ways.
- When we say of God that he is powerful, or has intellect, or is
  good, then, we should (so Aquinas argues, rightly in my view)
  understand these terms analogically. We are saying that there is in
  God something [analogous|univocal, equivocal, methaphorical,
  analogous] to what we call power in us.
- Reason itself thus tells us that there is a level of reality that
  reason can only partially comprehend.
- Everything is either a mind, or a mental content, or a material entity, or an abstract entity.

** Ch III - The Augustinian Argument

universals and propositions, numbers and other mathematical objects
are abstract objects.

Finally, consider what philosophers call possible worlds.

What worlds are possible, in the sense of “possible” in question here,
is not constrained by the laws of physics, but it is constrained by
the laws of logic.

Possible worlds too are obviously objects of thought,

So, in some sense there are abstract objects such as universals,
propositions, numbers and other mathematical objects, and possible
worlds.  But in what sense, exactly, do they exist?

Discussion on realism, conceptualism, and nominalism.

Discussion on forms of realism: Platonic, Aristotilian, and
Scholastic.

The Platonic form of realism—named after Plato, who was the first to
formulate a version of it—holds that if the abstract objects we have
been discussing depend for their existence neither on the material
world nor on the human mind, then they must exist in a “third realm”
that is neither material nor mental. This is the famous realm of
Platonic Forms, entities which exist outside time and space and which
the things of our experience merely imperfectly “resemble” or
“participate” in.

On Plato's realism: Platonic Forms and other denizens of the “third
realm” seem to be causally inert, yet if it has no causal powers, and
thus no effects on anything, then it would follow that it has no
effects on us. And in that case, how could we possibly even know about
it?

Aristotelian Realism:
- substance—something existing in its own right
- Aristotelian realism therefore denies that universals exist in a
  “third realm” of Forms.
- it holds that universals considered in abstraction from other
  features exist only in the mind, it also holds that universals exist
  in the extramental things themselves (albeit always tied there to
  other features).
- there are universals, propositions, mathematical objects,
  necessities, and possibilities that the Aristotelian realist is
  bound to have a more difficult time dealing with.

*Scholastic Realism*

Scholastic realism, which is essentially Aristotelian in spirit, but
gives at least a nod to Platonic realism.

Scholastic realism affirms that universals exist only either in the
things that instantiate them, or in intellects which entertain them.

Universals, propositions, mathematical and logical truths, and
necessities and possibilities exist in an infinite, eternal, divine
intellect

Realism about abstract objects entails the existence of a necessarily
existing intellect which is one, omniscient, omnipotent, fully good,
immutable, immaterial, incorporeal, and eternal. In short, it entails
the existence of God.

**Rebuttal**

If abstract objects exist on this mind, are they really abstract? We
don't know. What we call abstract objects is what the intellect forms
when it abstracts from particular things. If they are concrete in a
different way, that doesn't change our classification of them as
abstract objects in the sense just described.

Isn't assuming the abstract ideas exist independently of the human
mind already pressuposing they exist in an eternal mind? No. In the
argument, it is assumed they must exist somehow. 3 choices are
considered (platonic, aristotelian, ...), and only after evaluating
the alternatives it becomes clear that an eternal mind is needed.

** Ch IV - The Thomistics Proof

We can distinguish between a thing’s essence and its existence,
between what it is and the fact that it is.

if the essence and existence of a thing were not distinct features of
reality, then knowing the former should suffice for knowing the
latter, yet it doesn’t.

A second reason why the essences of the things of our experience must
be distinct from the existence of those things has to do with their
contingency—the fact that, though they do exist, they could have
failed to exist.

If existence were just part of what it is, then it would not need
something else to cause it, and there would not be anything in it that
could give it the potential to go out of existence.

there really is no sense to be made of there being more than one of
something which just is existence itself. And in that case there is no
way to make sense of there being more than one of something whose
essence and existence are not really distinct.  If there is such a
thing, it will be unique.

There really is no middle ground between the case where a thing’s
essence and existence are really distinct and the case where its
essence just is existence itself.

Naturally, then, a thing whose essence and existence are distinct
cannot impart existence to its own essence, for in that case it would
have to exist before it exists so as to cause itself to exist—which
makes no sense. Nothing can be the cause of its own existence.

for Fido to exist here and now and at any moment, his existence must
here and now be caused, whether directly or indirectly, by something
the essence of which is identical to its existence, something which is
subsistent existence itself. And that entails that it must be caused
by God.

*deriving the divine attributes*

As Aquinas emphasized, in a thing whose essence is distinct from its
existence, its essence and existence are related as potentiality and
actuality. Fido’s essence, for example, by itself amounts only to a
potential thing, not an actual thing. Only when Fido’s essence has
existence imparted to it is there an actual thing—namely, Fido. Now if
essence considered by itself is a kind of potentiality, and existence
considered by itself is a kind of actuality, then that which just is
existence, that which just is subsistent existence itself rather than
merely one derivatively existing thing alongside others, must be
purely actual.

Hence, the purely actual actualizer, to which the Aristotelian proof
leads, and that which just is subsistent existence, to which the
Thomistic proof leads, are really the same one cause of all things,
arrived at from different starting points.

Hence, that which is subsistent existence itself must be one,
necessarily existing, the uncaused cause of everything other than
itself, purely actual, immutable, eternal, immaterial, incorporeal,
perfect, omnipotent, fully good, intelligent, and omniscient. It is,
in short, God.

In general, for the Thomist, when the mind grasps the essence of a
thing, it grasps it as something distinct from its existence (or lack
thereof), even if that of which the existence is ultimately predicated
is the thing itself and not a mere concept.

It is also obvious that the essences of some things are at least in
part the product of convention. What makes something a carburetor or a
can opener, for example, is determined by the purposes for which we
make such artifacts.  For Thomists and many other philosophers,
however, the essences of at least some things, and in particular of
natural objects or substances, are real or mind-independent as opposed
to merely being the product of convention.  Essentialism is the thesis
that there are such real essences.

Aristotle’s view, expressed in book 2 of the Physics, that it would be
absurd to try to prove that things have natures. The idea is not that
it is doubtful that things have natures or essences, but rather that
it is obvious that they do —indeed, that the belief that things have
essences is more obviously correct than any argument that can be given
for or against it.

Precisely what a thing’s essence is is by no means always easy to
determine. But these considerations by themselves do not cast doubt on
the reality of essence.

the point is that the unity and order of things would be mystifying if
essence were not a pervasive feature of mind-independent reality.

** Ch. 0

*** 4 Problems w/ scientism

Four general problems with scientism. First, scientism is
self-defeating, and can avoid being self- defeating only at the cost
of becoming trivial and uninteresting. Sec- ond, the scientific method
cannot even in principle provide us with a complete description of
reality. Third, the “laws of nature” in terms of which science
explains phenomena cannot in principle provide us with a complete
explanation of reality. Fourth, what is probably the main argument in
favor of scientism – the argument from the predictive and
technological successes of modern physics and the other sciences – has
no force.

** Ch. 1 - Act and Potency

*** What is change?

Being-in-potency is thus a middle ground between being-in-act on the
one hand, and sheer nothingness or non-being on the other. And change
is not a matter of being arising from non- being, but rather of
being-in-act arising from being-in-potency. It is the actualization of
a potential – of something previously non-actual but still real.

*** Refuring Heraclitus on the non existing of being-in-act

how could the Heraclitean philoso- pher so much as reason through the
steps of his own argument so as to be convinced by it? For there will
on the Heraclitean view be no persisting subject, so that the person
who reaches the conclusion will not be the same as the person who
entertained the premises


*** TODO Understand Heraclitus, Zeno, and the Eleatics and their position about monism vs multiplicity, as well as change and static universe

*** A proof for the distinction of act and potency

That change and permanence, multiplicity and unity, are all real
features of the world cannot coherently be denied; but they can be
real features of the world only if there is a distinction in things
between what they are in act and what they are in potency; therefore
there is a distinction to be made in things between what they are in
act and what they are in potency.

*** My Take

We seek to explain change. Experience tells us that A turns into B (B
!= A). How can this be possible? We start by assuming there are only 2
cases for thing to be real: either something is REAL or it is NOT
REAL.

Start w/ a cup of hot coffe which is real. How can it become a cup of
cold coffee? Note that hot coffee is different than hold coffee. They
are not the same. How does the transformation happens? And recall, we
are trying to assume things are either REAL or NOT REAL.

In the universe at time T the hot coffee is REAL and the cold coffee
is NOT REAL. At time T2, the opposite is truth. Has the hot coffee
turned into NOT REAL, and the cold coffee turned into REAL? If that is
the case, then cold coffe (REAL) cames out of nothingness (NOT
REAL). This would be a miracle, and if we are to make sense of the
world, we cannot explain such common phenomena as miracles. We thus
are forced to reject that BEING can come out of NOT BEING. Had we
agreed to that, we would be losing our sense of reality.

Now, it is impossible then to explain change by defining only 2 states
(REAL and NOT REAL). We will add a third elemnt: BEING IN ACT, BEING
IN POTENCY, and NOT BEING.

We can now cay that the cold coffee existed in the hot coffee as BEING
IN POTENCY. When the hot coffee coolled down, the BEING IN POTENCY
became BEING IN ACT. Potentiality became actuality.

*** Logical Possibility and Real Potency

*** Passive Potency and Active Potency

An active potency is a power; a passive potency is a potentiality in
the strict sense

- Being
    * Logical possibility
    * Real Potency
        + Passive Potency (Potentiality) (capacity to be affected)
        + Active Potency (Actuality) (the capacity to bring about an effect)
- Passive potency and be analysed further into 2 ways:
    * When considered from the point of view of the being that has it:
        + Considered in relation to a thing's Essence
            - Note: the essence of a material thing can be further be broken into:
                * Prime matter (pure potentiality)
                * Second matter (matter in a given substancial form
                  (of a given kind of being), but still in potency to
                  receive accidents)
        + Considered in relation to a things existence
    * When considered from the point of view of an external being that
      brings about an effect in the being that has the potency
        + Natural passive potency
        + Supernatural passive potency
- Active potency:
    * when analyzed in purity:
        + pure actuality
        + mixed actuality
    * when analyzed what it is (entitative acts) vs what it does
      (operative acts)
        + entitative acts:
            - essential act. Further broke down into
                * substantial form (makes it the kind of substance it is)
                * accidental form (modifies an already existing substance)
            - existencial act
